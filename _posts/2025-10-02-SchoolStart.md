# School start 

### 1. Morning 
 I arrived at the Master‘s Room at 9:30, as part of my routine (what I do every morning). I turned on the air conditioner and put my lunch box into the refrigerator. While the water was boiling,I went to the lavatory and then made tea, after that, I turned on my desktop, checked the email, wrote a to-do list for the day, and started my work. Although I slept poorly last night because I encountered the X account of a senior at Kyoto university, I ended up researching that bitch professor’s news and information until midnight. I still got up early ,around 7 a.m. today, took a shower, and had breakfast with my girlfriend. I am proud of myself.

### 2. Study
 Recently, I am doing a general review of the previous studies. People can only imagine what they have been exposed to, and they can only understand what they already know. Through increasingly deeper research and extensive reading of journal article, I realized that I had a developed a clearer and more fluent understanding of the content, because I had completed Experiment 1. Additionally, I was able to read the original documents effortlessly, not the translated version, and I read them more fluently than translated version.

### 3. Caught by Obsidian 
 While reading ,I was caught by a problem with Obsidian, and then, I became absorbed in fixing it completely. Unawarely, it‘s time for lunch and class.

### 4. New lesson
 The new lesson called *Science Literacy* from this semester,is more interesting than I thought. Philosophy is truly amazing and complicated. I was randomly assigned to present an assigned book next week.

### 5. As a TA in *Strategic System thinking*
 I ran to the class taught by Prof. Ashi, where I serve as a teaching assistant. The classroom has a little distance from my department. But I was happy to meet my favorite professor, Prof. Ashi, and  to chat with him. He will retire next year, and has already started cleaning his office, but he still has to write and submit the application for research funding. Also, the Spring program still does not have any definite information, according to Prof. Kawakita. Serving as a teaching assistant is boring, perhaps only because this session was an orientation for the class.The other professors also seemed disengaged.  One took a nap,  another kept checking his phone, and another left for a meeting in the middle of class. So I started writing my journal in English ,something I want to do everyday but don‘t always have enough time for.
